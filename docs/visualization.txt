It would be nice to be able to better visualize the following during execution of my SPP search:

 - elapsed time in milliseconds
 - elapsed clocks used
 - depth
 - f-cost
 - g-cost
 - h-cost
 - # characters needed
 - # characters acquired
 - # successors per expansion
 - average branching factor
 - # expansions
 - size of starting cache
 - size of ending cache
 - estimate of at what depth we'll find the solution
 - estimate of how long it will take to find the solution
